# TMA EngineOS KOE Librosa API - Basic Pitch Implementation Summary

## âœ… Phase 1: Repository Microagent Creation

**Completed:**
- Created comprehensive microagent documentation in `.openhands/microagents/repo.md`
- Analyzed existing repository structure and functionality
- Documented API patterns, deployment info, and integration guidelines
- Provided development best practices and extension guidelines

**Key Insights:**
- Repository serves as Python backend for TMA EngineOS KOE Engine
- Uses Flask with Railway deployment
- Existing Librosa integration for tempo, key, and harmonic analysis
- API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header
- Integration with Base44 frontend via serverless functions

## âœ… Phase 2: Basic Pitch Integration Implementation

### Core Features Implemented

**1. Basic Pitch Integration**
- Added Spotify's Basic Pitch for automatic music transcription
- Precise note detection with MIDI-quality output
- Pitch range analysis and note duration statistics
- Melody line extraction using time-windowed analysis

**2. Librosa Fallback System**
- Enhanced Librosa analysis when Basic Pitch is unavailable
- Chroma analysis for note distribution
- Onset detection for rhythm analysis
- Pitch tracking using piptrack algorithm
- Graceful degradation ensuring API reliability

**3. New API Endpoints**
- Extended `/analyze` endpoint with `music_theory` field
- New dedicated `/music-theory` endpoint for focused analysis
- Consistent JSON response format across both endpoints
- Maintained existing authentication and error handling patterns

### Technical Implementation

**Dependencies Added:**
```
basic-pitch>=0.3.0,<0.5.0
tensorflow>=2.16.0,<2.21.0
pretty-midi>=0.2.9,<1.0.0

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "music_theory": {
    "method": "basic_pitch|librosa_fallback",
    "total_notes": 342,
    "pitch_range": {
      "lowest_note": "C4",
      "highest_note": "C6",
      "range_semitones": 24
    },
    "most_common_notes": [["C", 45], ["E", 38]],
    "note_durations": {

      "shortest": 0.1,
      "longest": 2.3
    },
    "melody_line": [
      {"time": 0.0, "note_name": "C5", "pitch": 72}
    ]
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Compatibility

**Current Status:**
