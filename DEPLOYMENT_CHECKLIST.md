## ðŸ”§ Railway Environment Setup

### Environment Variables Required:
```
LIBROSA_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
PORT=5000
```

### Expected Railway Behavior:
1. **Build Phase**: Install TensorFlow and Basic Pitch (may take 5-10 minutes)
2. **Runtime**: Basic Pitch model download on first use (~100MB)
3. **Fallback**: If Basic Pitch fails, Librosa analysis continues seamlessly

## ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/
# Expected: {"status":"KOE Librosa API is running!","version":"1.0"}
```

### 2. Existing Endpoints (Backward Compatibility)
```bash
# Test existing analyze endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/analyze \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"audio_url": "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/bell-ringing-05.wav"}'

# Should include new "music_theory" field in response
```

### 3. New Chord Extraction Endpoint
```bash
# Test chord-to-MIDI extraction
curl -X POST https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/extract-chords-midi \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "audio_url": "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/bell-ringing-05.wav",
    "include_tracks": ["chords", "bass"]
  }'
```

### 4. MIDI Download
```bash
# Test MIDI file download (use URL from previous response)
curl -X GET https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/download-midi/chords_123456789.mid \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -o test_download.mid
```

### 5. Music Theory Endpoint
```bash
# Test dedicated Basic Pitch analysis
curl -X POST https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/music-theory \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"audio_url": "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/bell-ringing-05.wav"}'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

### Successful Response Format:
```json
{
  "method": "basic_pitch|librosa_fallback",
  "total_chords": 8,
  "tempo": 120.0,
  "duration": 30.5,
  "tracks_included": ["chords", "bass", "melody"],
  "midi_download_url": "/download-midi/chords_1234567890.mid",
  "chord_progression": [
    {
      "time": 0.0,
      "duration": 2.0,
      "chord_name": "C Major",
      "root": "C",
      "chord_type": "Major",
      "notes": ["C", "E", "G"],
      "midi_notes": [60, 64, 67],
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸš¨ Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: TensorFlow Installation Timeout
**Symptom**: Railway build fails during pip install
**Solution**: Railway should handle this automatically, but may take 10+ minutes

### Issue 2: Basic Pitch Model Download
**Symptom**: First request takes 30+ seconds
**Solution**: Expected behavior - model downloads on first use

### Issue 3: Memory Usage
**Symptom**: Railway container restarts
**Solution**: Basic Pitch uses ~1GB RAM, should be fine on Railway

### Issue 4: Fallback Activation
**Symptom**: All requests use "librosa_fallback" method
**Solution**: This is normal if Basic Pitch has issues, functionality still works

## ðŸŽ¹ Base44 Frontend Integration

### Update your Base44 frontend to use new endpoints:

```javascript
// New chord extraction endpoint
const response = await fetch('https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/extract-chords-midi', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    audio_url: audioUrl,
    include_tracks: ['chords', 'bass', 'melody']
  })
});

const result = await response.json();

// Download MIDI file
if (result.midi_download_url) {
  const midiUrl = `https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app${result.midi_download_url}`;
  // Provide download link to user
}
```

## âœ… Deployment Success Indicators

- [x] All endpoints respond with 200 status
- [x] Chord extraction returns valid chord progressions
- [x] MIDI files generate and download successfully
- [x] Both Basic Pitch and Librosa fallback work
- [x] Existing functionality remains unchanged
- [x] Base44 frontend can integrate new features
